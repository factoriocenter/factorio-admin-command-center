Date: 2025-06-30
  Gui:
    - Sidebar scroll pane: revamped the left-hand menu into a vertically scrollable list, styled with `inside_shallow_frame`.

  Features:
    - Persistent restoration: if the GUI was open when saving, it remains open and fully interactive after reload.
    - Content panel sizing: content area enforces a minimal height and uses an inner scroll-pane for long lists.
