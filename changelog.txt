Version: 2.2.0
Date: 2025-04-30
  Major Features:
    - Introduced **Legendary Upgrader** selection tool: drag-select an area to convert every built entity and ghost to legendary quality using a temporary upgrade-planner. (Based on the mod Quality upgrade planner by Quezler)
  Features:
    - Unified real-entity and ghost conversion into one streamlined workflow.
    - Chat notifications when the tool is equipped, on error, and upon successful conversion.
  Optimizations:
    - Unique prototype mapping: each prototype is registered only once to eliminate redundant `set_mapper` calls.
  Scripting:
    - All upgrader logic consolidated into a single `legendary_upgrader.lua` script for easier maintenance and modding.
  Control:
    - Added toolbar shortcut (`facc_give_legendary_upgrader`) to instantly equip the Legendary Upgrader (fully remappable).
  Ease of use:
    - Automatic cleanup of the temporary inventory after upgrade.
  Bugfixes:
    - Prevent crashes when encountering prototypes lacking `filter_slot_count` or `item_prototypes`.
    - Fixed argument-count errors and bad-argument errors in `set_mapper` calls.
  Info:
    - Permission checks ensure only single-player or admin users may run the upgrader.

Date: 2025-04-28

    - Simplified the GUI by merging ghost construction actions into one streamlined command.
