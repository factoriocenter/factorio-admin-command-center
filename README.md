# 🛠️ Factorio Admin Command Center (FACC)

**Factorio Admin Command Center** is a powerful GUI-based toolkit built entirely with ChatGPT (OpenAI), designed for admins and single-player users who want total control over their factory world. Although the initial and subsequent versions were generated by AI, each feature has been rigorously tested in-game to guarantee reliability and excellence. Crafted with care by Louan "LoadSec" Fontenele, this mod reflects personal passion shared with the community.
