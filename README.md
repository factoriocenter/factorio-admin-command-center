## 🏆 Using Mods Without Disabling Achievements

By default, Factorio disables achievements when mods are active — but you can **re-enable achievements** using external tools designed for this.

> ⚠️ Use at your own risk. These tools patch the game to restore achievement functionality while mods are active.
